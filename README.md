# CityStates
## A city building game

In this game, you will build up tiles and monitor growth as pops (simulated populations) and resources move around and change.  Eventually, there will be natural disasters and the possibility to invade/be invaded by AI enemies.  Progress will be slow as I do this in my spare time, and I am not heavily invested in this project (hence the one year gap), but I do plan to keep working on this project and slowly making it into something interesting.
